    "To visualize how the flight numbers are distributed across different launch sites.  \n",
    "This can help identify trends in launch sequences and site usage over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it’s important:**  \n",
    "- Flight number represents the chronological order of launches.  \n",
    "- Launch site shows where the rocket was launched from.  \n",
    "- Together, these can reveal if certain sites were used more often at specific stages in SpaceX’s launch history.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**  \n",
    "- Use a scatter plot with `Flight Number` on the X-axis and `Launch Site` on the Y-axis.  \n",
    "- Color points by `Launch Outcome` to differentiate successful vs failed launches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Insight:**  \n",
    "- Identify which launch sites handled more missions and whether there is any chronological pattern in site usage.\n"

The MicroGEOs were launched to a custom geostationary orbit, with the four satellites individually conducting on-orbit maneuvers to inject themselves into their orbital slots. The four spacecraft were mounted to a standard adapter ring, known as an ESPA-Grande, for ease of deployment.[248] B1083 supported the Astranis mission, previously it was B1077, but due to some problem identified, the first stage of this mission was changed.",

    "# Objective:\n",
    "To visualize the average success rate of SpaceX launches for each orbit type.\n",
    "This helps identify which orbits are more reliable for successful launches.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why it’s important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Orbit type affects mission complexity and risk.\n",
    "Visualizing success rate by orbit highlights patterns in mission outcomes depending on the orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group the dataset by Orbit and calculate the success rate (success_flag).\n",
    "Use a bar chart with Orbit on the X-axis and success rate on the Y-axis.\n",
    "Color bars by success rate for better visual impact.\n",

First crewed mission to launch from SLC-40.[181] The launch carried two members of the Expedition 72 crew, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with a small amount of cargo to the ISS.[180] Due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner Calypso the crew complement of the launch was reduced down to two and Barry E. Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the crew of the Boeing Crew Flight Test, joined the Crew-9 and Expedition 72 crew complement.[182] The second stage experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn that ran for an extra 500 milliseconds, and while it landed safely in the ocean, it landed short of the targeted area.[183] SpaceX said they would temporarily halt launches while time was spent understanding the root cause. Several days later the FAA said they would require an investigation into the failure before issuing a return to flight for the Falcon 9. It marked the third time in a span of three months that the Falcon 9 suffered an anomaly temporarily stopping launches.[184][185] On October 11, the FAA approved the Falcon 9 to return to flight for low-Earth orbit missions, after granting approval for the Hera launch due to its heliocentric orbit.[186]",

Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the crew of the Boeing Crew Flight Test, joined the Crew-9 and Expedition 72 crew complement.[182] The second stage experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn that ran for an extra 500 milliseconds, and while it landed safely in the ocean, it landed short of the targeted area.[183] SpaceX said they would temporarily halt launches while time was spent understanding the root cause.

It marked the third time in a span of three months that the Falcon 9 suffered an anomaly temporarily stopping launches.[184][185] On October 11, the FAA approved the Falcon 9 to return to flight for low-Earth orbit missions, after granting approval for the Hera launch due to its heliocentric orbit.[186]",

      "- Second and last launch of Galileo navigation satellites on Falcon 9. Originally planned to launch on Soyuz, but canceled after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Launch was shifted to the new Ariane 6 rocket, but the program was delayed.[176] On the previous Galileo launch, the booster was expended due to a lack of fuel for a landing. However, that launch provided data that allowed SpaceX to make design and operational changes to recover the booster on this launch. The company said this landing attempt would test the bounds of recovery.[175]\n",
      "- Long-duration mission to the International Space Station (ISS). First crewed mission to launch from SLC-40.[181] The launch carried two members of the Expedition 72 crew, Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, along with a small amount of cargo to the ISS.[180] Due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner Calypso the crew complement of the launch was reduced down to two and Barry E. Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the crew of the Boeing Crew Flight Test, joined the Crew-9 and Expedition 72 crew complement.[182] The second stage experienced an off-nominal deorbit burn that ran for an extra 500 milliseconds, and while it landed safely in the ocean, it landed short of the targeted area.[183] SpaceX said they would temporarily halt launches while time was spent understanding the root cause. Several days later the FAA said they would require an investigation into the failure before issuing a return to flight for the Falcon 9. It marked the third time in a span of three months that the Falcon 9 suffered an anomaly temporarily stopping launches.[184][185] On October 11, the FAA approved the Falcon 9 to return to flight for low-Earth orbit missions, after granting approval for the Hera launch due to its heliocentric orbit.[186]\n",
      "- Hera is a European Space Agency mission under its Space Safety program. Its primary goal is to study the aftermath of NASA's DART mission, which intentionally collided with the Didymos binary asteroid system. By analyzing the crater formed and the momentum transferred during the impact, Hera will help validate the kinetic impact method as a potential strategy for deflecting a near-Earth asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The mission will provide data on the efficiency of this technique. It also carries two nano-satellite CubeSats, called Milani and Juventas. This was the second booster to complete its 23rd flight. Although the Falcon 9 remained unable to launch following the Crew-9 mishap, the FAA granted an exemption for the Hera launch, as it did not involve a second-stage reentry.[188] First stage was expended because all of its performance were needed to go to the heliocentric orbit.\n",
      "- Europa Clipper will conduct a detailed survey of Europa and use a sophisticated suite of science instruments to investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life. Key mission objectives are to produce high-resolution images of Europa's surface, determine its composition, look for signs of recent or ongoing geological activity, measure the thickness of the moon's icy shell, search for subsurface lakes, and determine the depth and salinity of Europa's ocean.[190][191] The spacecraft will fly past Mars and Earth before arriving at Jupiter in April 2030.[192][193] At 45,648 km/h (28,364 mph) the launch had the highest-speed payload injection ever achieved by SpaceX, however to reach that speed, the core and side boosters were expended without grid fins and landing legs.[194][195]\n",
